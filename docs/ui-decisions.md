## ✅ Implemented in code — 2026-06-11

**New component:** `components/IconButton` — canonical close/icon button (32px circle, neutral700, hover tint, accessible `ariaLabel`, defaults to a ✕).

**CLOSE-canon — done.** ~12 modal/panel close ✕ buttons replaced with `<IconButton>`: ChatPanel, BillMedicinesModal, AddServiceModal, AddReportModal, EditPatientModal (×2), NewPrescriptionModal, PrescriptionPage (Save-template + AI-SOAP modals), FileViewer, AddStaffModal, PharmacyView (shared `ModalHeader`). Dead `closeBtn`/`CloseIcon` styles removed. _Left as follow-up: chip-remove ✕ (Tag/Autocomplete), field-clear ✕, Toast dismiss._

**CTA-canon — done.** Modal footers now use `<Button variant="light">` Cancel + `<Button variant="primary">` Save: EditPatient / AddReport / NewPrescription / AddService / Pharmacy / ImportData. **Retained:** the Archive-patient underline link, and Pharmacy's destructive `Remove` (`btnDanger`). Dead `btnPrimary`/`btnGhost`/`saveBtn`/`cancelBtn` styles removed.

**dangerLight removed.** All 8 usages were Cancel/Nope buttons → switched to `light` (AppointmentQueue ×2, BookAppointment, AddStaffModal ×2, SessionBar ×2, HomePage). Variant deleted from `Button.styles.ts` + `Button.tsx` union + DesignSystem demo array.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` → 0 errors; webpack compiles clean; `/audit` gallery updated to show the shipped state. ⚠️ NOT visually verified in the running app (login wall) — recommend a manual click-through of the affected modals.

**Also now done (2026-06-11):** `secondary`↔`secondarySolid` merge (secondary = secondary700 → 800 hover; TopNav repointed) · grey disabled for all 6 variants (filled neutral200/neutral500/no-stroke; outline neutral400) · `md` height +2px (44/36). **The Button category is fully implemented + committed (`batman`).**

### Button variant decisions — FINAL 2026-06-11 (8 → 6 variants)
- **primary** — ✅ keep as-is.
- **dark** — ✅ keep; hover neutral900 → neutral1000. _Already implemented ([Button.styles.ts:61]); no change._
- **secondary** — 🔧 MERGE `secondary` + `secondarySolid` → one `secondary` using the **secondarySolid** values (default secondary700, hover secondary800, disabled secondary300); drop old `secondary` (800→700).
  - Impact: `TopNav.tsx:249` `"secondarySolid"`→`"secondary"` + simplify ternary; remove `secondarySolid` from `Button.tsx` union. **LoginCard admin Sign-in** (`LoginCard.tsx:194,281`, currently `secondary`=800) shifts to the lighter 700 look + darken-on-hover — minor intended visual change.
- **primaryLight** — ✅ KEEP (themed outline, active.shade600). Note: **0 current usages** — reserved for future themed secondary-outline actions.
- **dangerLight** — 🗑️ REMOVE. Used 8× but ONLY as the red "Cancel/Nope" button in confirm dialogs (the destructive action is `dark`). Switch all 8 → `variant="light"` (neutral grey outline); remove the variant + type-union entry + DesignSystem demo entry.
  - Sites → `light`: `AddStaffModal.tsx:310,330` · `BookAppointment.tsx:1201` · `AppointmentQueue.tsx:586,804` · `SessionBar.tsx:462,499` · `HomePage.tsx:353`.
- **secondaryLight** — ✅ keep.  ·  **light** — ✅ keep.
- **text = outline** (primaryLight / secondaryLight / light) — ✅ ALREADY the case in every state (verified rendered: primaryLight #E48647, secondaryLight #6C8145, light #202020, incl. disabled). No change.
- **disabled** — ✅ APPROVED **grey**: filled (primary/dark/secondary) → neutral200 fill + neutral500 text + **no stroke**; outline (primaryLight/secondaryLight/light) → neutral400 border + matching neutral400 text. Apply to all 6 `disabled` blocks in Button.styles.ts.
- **sizes** — ✅ sm unchanged (`--btn-sm-h` 40/32). md **+2px → 44/36** (was 42/34) for a real 4px gap. Fix: globals.css `--btn-md-h: 44` (:root) + `34→36` (compact media). Note `mdIcon` also reads `--btn-md-h`, so it tracks to 44/36 too (fine/consistent).
- **responsiveness** — buttons step down one tier <1440 (h 40→32 / 42→34, fs 16→14) via --btn-* vars; padding/radius/border/icon fixed. ✅ confirmed behaviour.
- **FINAL SET (6): `primary · dark · secondary · primaryLight · secondaryLight · light`**
- _Design note: Cancel red→grey is a deliberate change to those 8 dialogs. The destructive confirm stays `dark` (filled black), NOT red — flagged, not changed (that was option 3, which you didn't pick)._

## 2. Inputs — _✅ BUILT 2026-06-11_
IDs: `INP-CANON/select/domain/box35/box40/pill`, `INV-1..4` + `INV-CANON`, `INP-FIELD*`.
DECISION:
- ✅ Approve one canonical `<Field variant size error>` component (3 looks).
- **Looks kept, assigned by context (no field changes its look):** `underline` stays where underline is today; `box` stays where box is today; `pill` is ONLY for search inputs (e.g. PatientPicker search). Today's placement already matches, so this is a consolidation, not a re-style.
- **Standardize heights + make them RESPONSIVE** — `<Field>` reads `--input-h` (40px baseline → **32px on the 1200–1439 tier**) + `--input-pady` (6→3), so every field compacts together on smaller laptops. Today only `TextInput` & `Select` honor this; DomainInput (54), the boxed inputs (35/40), PatientPicker pill (48) and the pickers hardcode their height and DON'T compact — a real bug the `<Field>` fixes. Kills the 35/40/48/54 scatter. DomainInput's suffix box is the one possible exception (confirm during build).
- **One invalid state:** `red200` border + `redAlpha10` soft fill (INV-CANON) — replaces the 5 ad-hoc error looks incl. `rgba(255,0,0,0.05)` and raw `1px solid red`.
- ✅ BUILT: new `components/Field` (underline/box/pill, responsive via `--input-h`, unified `red200 + redAlpha10` error). `TextInput` is now a thin alias of `<Field variant="underline">`. DomainInput made responsive + unified error; PatientPicker search → `<Field variant="pill">`; the boxed form inputs (Pharmacy / NewPrescription / EditPatient) now use `--input-h` so they compact on the lower tier. Also fixed a pre-existing React border-shorthand warning in Select + DomainInput.
- _Optional follow-up:_ migrate every remaining inline form `<input>` to `<Field>`; make the Select/date-trigger buttons compact too (the agent flagged `selectInput`/`selectTrigger`/`dobTrigger` still hardcode their height).

## 3. Dropdowns / selects — _✅ BUILT 2026-06-11_
IDs: `MENU-select/primary/underline/picker/destructive`, `MENU-CANON`, `TRIG-*`.
DECISION:
- **Menu surface = thin warm border + soft shadow** (Option A = the `MENU-primary` look already used by ~22 files): bg neutral100, `1px primary300` border, `radii.m`, ONE soft shadow, hover `active.shade100`, selected `primary100` + `primary700` text.
- **Reconcile the 2 outliers** to match: the official `Select` menu (today borderless + `2px 2px 12px` offset shadow) → add the `primary300` border + the standard shadow; `UnderlineSelect` (12px literal radius + `0 4px 20px` shadow) → `radii.m` + standard shadow.
- **Add a `shadows` token** to theme.ts (one menu shadow, e.g. `0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`) — kills the 8+ ad-hoc shadow strings; menus point at it.
- ✅ **3 TYPES KEPT, each for a context** (2026-06-11 refinement): `primary` (the default bordered look), `underline` (sticky header ONLY), `picker` (Rx / prescription form). They share the bordered panel + chevron + responsive height, and differ only in their trigger + usage context.
- ✅ **Unified the chevron**: all 3 types now use the canonical `ChevronDown` @ 16px. Select's flat 14×6 arrow and the pickers' `chevron-up.svg` (inverted rotation) were both swapped for it. (The rotation DIRECTION was already correct everywhere — only the icon changed.)
- ✅ **Compact lower tier (<1440):** the 5 picker triggers now use `--input-h` (40 → 32 on the lower tier), matching the field compaction; Select already did; the underline trigger compacts via the type scale.
- ✅ **Fixed off-token destructive colour** `#c0392b` → `red200` (PopoverMenu).
- ✅ BUILT: `shadows` token added to theme.ts (`menu`/`modal`/`card`); `Select` + `UnderlineSelect` menus reconciled to the bordered look + `shadows.menu` + cream hover / `primary100` selected.
- _Follow-up:_ point the ~22 menus that already hardcode `0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` at `shadows.menu` (same value, single-source); optionally extract a shared `<Menu>`/`<Popover>` primitive so the panel isn't hand-rolled in ~22 files.

## 4. Modals / dialogs — _✅ BUILT 2026-06-11_
IDs: `MOD-canon`, `MOD-print/bill/service/presets/confirm/slot/ai`, `MOD-CANON-PROPOSED`.
DECISION (approved the proposed canonical Modal, with 2 tweaks):
- ✅ Adopt one canonical `<Modal>` shell: tokenized backdrop (one opacity, e.g. `alphaBlack3`), a real **`zIndex` scale** in theme.ts (fixes the 1000→4000 chaos + the base-Modal-sitting-under-its-own-confirm-dialog bug), one radius, one shadow (`shadows.modal`), Esc-to-close + scroll-lock by default.
- 🔸 ~~**RETAIN each modal's existing background colour** — do NOT unify the surface.~~ **SUPERSEDED 2026-06-12 — surfaces ARE now unified, see "Modal surface + header canon" below.**
- 🔸 **Close ✕ = the shared IconButton (CLOSE-CANON)** — already done for the ~12 modal closes converted in the Buttons phase; the canonical Modal uses IconButton for its header ✕.
- ✅ BUILT: rebuilt `<Modal>` (tokenized backdrop / `shadows.modal` / `radii["2xl"]` + Esc + scroll-lock + `surface`/`width`/`level` props, back-compat defaults so the 16 existing callers are unchanged except the z-index fix). Added a `zIndex` scale to theme.ts (modal 4000 — above the sidebar; modalTop 4100 for confirm-over-modal). Migrated the 7 hand-rolled overlays onto `<Modal>` keeping their colours: PrintPreview, BillMedicines (surface transparent — preserves the zigzag), AddService, SchedulePresets, AddStaff delete-confirm (`level="top"`), slot-picker, AI-SOAP.
- ⚠️ NOT click-tested live (login wall) — recommend a manual pass: open a couple of modals (do they appear ABOVE the sidebar now? does Esc close them? does the bill receipt's torn edge still show the dark backdrop?).

### Modal surface + header canon — REVISED 2026-06-12 (the rulebook)
Reviewed all ~15 modals side-by-side (audit + Storybook §17). They drifted: 3 surfaces (tray-tint `#F3F3DC` default · white · cream `#F9F9ED`), random widths (360/420/440/460/560/1000/1040), padding 0/24/32, title left vs centre, close as IconButton vs square SVG vs raw `×`. Decisions (user-approved):

**Three modal TYPES:**
| Type | When | Surface | Title | Close ✕ | Width | Footer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Confirm** | yes/no, cancel/confirm, "are you sure?", delete/archive | match the form/context surface (white default) | **centred** | top-right | S 400 | buttons centred (light Cancel + dark Confirm) |
| **Form** | create/edit records (Edit patient, Add service, Pharmacy, New Rx…) | **white** (`neutral100`) | **left** | top-right | M 480 · L 560 | right-aligned (light Cancel + primary Save) |
| **Workbench** | wide editors / receipts (Bill, Bill & medicines, Print preview) | white (`transparent` only for the torn-edge receipt) | left or section heading | top-right | XL 1040, `padding=0` + internal layout | in-layout (e.g. Pay + print/share icons) |

**Universal (every modal):** radius `radii.2xl` (16) · backdrop `rgba(0,0,0,0.35)` · `shadows.modal` · **close is ALWAYS `<IconButton>` ✕, top-right** (never a raw `×` or one-off square button) · z-index from the scale (modal 4000 / modalTop 4100).

**Width scale:** S 400 · M 480 · L 560 · XL 1040. Pick the nearest; don't invent new numbers.

**Surface exceptions (explicit):**
- **Add staff → cream `primary100`** (user wants this one to stay distinct from the white form crowd).
- **Bill & medicines → `transparent`** (the two-card torn-edge receipt floats on the backdrop).
- Everything else: forms + confirms = **white**.

**Heading:** left for normal modals; **centred only for confirm-type** dialogs. Font = secondary serif, `fonts.size.h6`/`h5`.

**Rollout = doc + Storybook reference only (2026-06-12).** Did NOT mass-migrate. Storybook §17 now shows the three types + the rulebook as the canonical reference. Per-modal migration to the canon is a later sweep (most forms still render the tray-tint default surface today). **A shared `ModalHeader` (title + ✕, alignment baked in) should be promoted from PharmacyView and used everywhere when the migration happens** — that's what stops the header drifting again.

### Chevron icon — updated 2026-06-11
The canonical `ChevronDown` now uses the path you provided (`M19 9L12 15L5 9`, strokeWidth 1.5), colour driven by the `color` prop (not hardcoded). Propagates to all 3 dropdown types.

## 5. Nav / tabs (TABS only) — _✅ BUILT 2026-06-11_
IDs: `TAB-block/rxfilter/stats/visit/pharmacy/connected/clinic`, `CHIP-conflict`, `HDR-pageheader/rx/settings`, `TAB-CANON`.
DECISION (per A/B/C/D/E review):
- **E = canonical** white-pill `<Tabs>`. ✅ Now has TWO sizes: `md` (the larger "E") and `size="sm"` (the smaller "visit"). RESPONSIVE: `md` compacts 40/r12 → 32/r8 below 1440 via new `--tab-md-h` / `--tab-md-r` vars (so at the lower tier all tabs read like the visit size; above 1440 both sizes are available).
- **A (white-pill clones):** Rx-filter (`PrescriptionQueue.styles`) + Stats strip (`StatsPage`) aligned to the responsive `--tab-md-*` vars. (Full migration of these hand-rolled bars onto the `<Tabs>` component itself = optional follow-up; visually + responsively they now match.)
- **B:** Pharmacy `togglePill` → the white pill (was an inverted dark pill, which even contradicted its own code comment) + responsive. The sort/range **chips RETAINED** as-is.
- **C (legacy trapezoid)** + **D (headers: PageHeader / rxHeader / Settings)** — RETAINED as-is per your call.
- _Not built:_ headers were explicitly kept, so the earlier "fold rxHeader/Settings into PageHeader" idea is dropped.
- ⚠️ Not click-tested live (login wall) — recommend resizing the window across 1440 to confirm tabs compact.

## 6. Cards — _✅ BUILT 2026-06-11_
IDs: `CARD-R8/R16/R20`, `CARD-BG-*`, `CARD-canon/bill/clinic/clinicdisplay/clinicinfo/hint/staff/addstaff/docstatus/heatmap/login/kpi`, `CARD-CANON`.
DECISION (per the 4-question review):
- **Corners → 16 everywhere.** Snap ALL card surfaces to `radii.2xl(16)` — retiring the legacy `radii.primary(20)` *and* pulling the 8px staff/kpi tiles up to 16. One card radius. (radii.primary stays in theme.ts for Tabs/ClinicTabs/Modal/Workspace/SetupPassword — mopped up in their own categories.)
- **Keep the soft shadow** on the clinic card. Both clinic cards are now `raised`; everything else flat.
- **Keep all 3 paper colours** as meaningful variants: `sage`(secondary50)=clinic · `cream`(primary100)=staff/queue · `surface`(neutral100 white)=bills/stats. Login stays its own themed bg (just corner-snapped).
- **Merge all 3 near-twin sets** at the surface level (not a risky whole-component collapse, since I can't click-test):
  - **clinic** — ClinicCard + ClinicDisplayCard now both spread `cardSurface("sage","raised")` (ClinicCard *gains* the shadow; ClinicDisplay's literal shadow → `shadows.card` token; both → 16).
  - **staff** — StaffDetailsCard + AdditionalStaffDetailsCard both spread `cardSurface("cream","none")` (8 → 16). Only their inner content gap still differs (intended).
  - **queue-sidebar** — DoctorStatusCard + HeatmapCard both spread `cardSurface("cream","none")` (literal "20px" → 16).
- ✅ BUILT: new **`cardSurface(variant, elevation)`** helper in `components/Card/Card.styles.ts` = ONE source for every card's paper (bg + 16 radius + optional `shadows.card`). The 6 merge-pair cards spread it; bespoke cards (Hint dashed, Login themed, Bill torn-edge) keep their look but got corner-snapped to 16; StatsPage `kpiCard` → 16. The `<Card>` component now also takes optional `variant`/`elevation`/`padding` props (defaulting to the legacy transparent shell, so the existing section-wrapper callers are untouched).
- _Not done (deliberate, flagged for follow-up):_ (a) full component-collapse of the clinic family into one parametrised component — surfaces are unified, contents still live in separate files; (b) the clinic-family **tag pill** still diverges (`secondary700` filled on ClinicCard vs `secondary300` on ClinicDisplay/ClinicInfo) — that's content, not surface; pick one in a quick later pass.
- ⚠️ NOT click-tested live (login wall) — `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors. Spot-check please: clinic cards (rounder + now have a soft shadow), the staff form cards + Stats KPI tiles (8→16, slightly rounder), and the queue sidebar (doctor/heatmap corners).

## 7. Tables / lists — _✅ BUILT 2026-06-11_
IDs: `TBL-queue` (canonical), `TBL-rx/pharmacy/archived/stats`, `TBL-DIV`, `TBL-PILLS`, `TBL-CANON`.
DECISION (per the 4-question review):
- **Approach = unify the look only** (user had no preference; I took the safe path since the live app can't be click-tested behind the login wall). NO full `<DataTable>` component — that would rewrite each table's data/click/sort/timer logic blind. Left as a future option.
- **Fix the Stats outlier.** Its header was `neutral500` / weight 500 vs everyone else's `alphaBlack3` / 400 — brought into line.
- **Leave corners as-is.** The 10/16/24/asymmetric card radii were explicitly KEPT (incl. the appointment-queue table's intentional `"0 24px 24px 24px"` tab-tuck, which tucks it under its Tabs). No radius changes.
- **Merge the two status pills** into one shared `StatusBadge`.
- ✅ BUILT:
  - New **`styles/tableStyles.ts`** — `tableHeadCell` (alphaBlack3 / weight 400 / `primary300` divider) + `tableDivider`. The 5 tables (AppointmentQueue, PrescriptionQueue, Pharmacy, ArchivedPatients, Stats) now spread `tableHeadCell` into their `th` and use `tableDivider` for row/cell borders. The 4 already-matching tables become a no-op single-source; Stats is the one visible fix.
  - **Pill merge:** `StatusBadge` gained an optional **`started`** prop — when `started && status===IN_PROGRESS` it reads **"Ongoing" on `secondary100`** (no timer), matching the retired rx pill. The appointment queue's `patientId`→live-timer path is unchanged. `PrescriptionQueue` now renders `<StatusBadge started>`; the duplicate `StatusPill` + `pillStyles` were deleted, and dead `fonts`/`spacing` imports trimmed.
- _Not done (deliberate, flagged):_ (a) full `<DataTable>` component; (b) the `PatientFilesPage` → `AppointmentQueue.styles` cross-page coupling still stands — it now inherits the shared header look transitively, but ideally imports `tableStyles` + its own container; (c) unknown rx statuses now render as a grey pill (StatusBadge fallback) instead of grey text — minor, arguably nicer.
- ⚠️ NOT click-tested live (login wall) — `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors. Spot-check please: **prescription queue** pills (esp. a started session → "Ongoing" sage pill; and that the appointment queue's live timer is unaffected) and the **Stats** overdue/dues table header (now soft-black, lighter).

## 8. Icons — _🔧 PARTIAL: safe-cleanup shipped 2026-06-11; rest deferred_
IDs: `ICON-dups-1a..5b`, `ICON-chevron-1..3`, `ICON-close-1..4`, `ICON-size-*`, `ICON-color-*`, `ICON-CANON-*`.
DECISION:
- **Canonical approved** ("icon-canon proposed ones are fine"): one `<Icon name size color>` @24 + `currentColor`, every asset normalized to `viewBox 0 0 24 24`.
- **Scope = SAFE CLEANUP ONLY** (user's pick, since the live app can't be click-tested behind the login wall). The risky/visual parts are deferred.
- ✅ BUILT (shipped): **deleted the 8 truly-dead `.svg` files** (verified 0 refs): `circle-outline`, `circle-outline-2`, `chevron-down-dark`, `chevron-down-light`, `horizontal-line-short-2`, `vertical-line-tall`, `stethoscope-cup`, `curved-connector`. Gallery imports/tiles for those updated so the build stays green.
  - ⚠️ **Audit was wrong:** it listed 11 dead files, but **3 are still in use** — `bill-check-small.svg` (PrescriptionPage:9), `users-group-rounded.svg` (PrescriptionPage:22), `paid-stamp.svg` (BillCard:6) — so only 8 were deleted.
- ⏸️ **DEFERRED (needs click-testing — visual changes):** the shared `<Icon>` component + registry; stripping baked hex → `currentColor` on the ~11 colour-baked assets (would re-colour icons across screens); merging the LIVE look-alikes (`restart`/`restart-24` differ on stroke width, etc.); swapping inline ✕/chevron redraws for the component. (Note the ChatPanel single-diagonal ✕ "slash" bug from `ICON-close-2` was already fixed in the Buttons phase via `IconButton`.)
- `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors.

## 9. Colors outside tokens — _✅ BUILT 2026-06-11_
IDs: `CLR-grey-1..9`, `CLR-amber-1..3`, `CLR-red-1..4`, `CLR-invalidfill-1/2`, `CLR-green-1..3`.
DECISION (per verdicts):
- **Grey ramp → neutral\*** — do all suggested: `#222`→neutral900 · `#555`→neutral700 · `#666`→neutral600 · `#888`→neutral500 · `#aaa`→neutral400 · `#bbb`→neutral300 · `#fafafa`→neutral150. (`#444`/`#999` had **no live usage** → skipped.)
- **Amber banners → CLR-amber-3** (the tokenized look): `yellowAlpha10` fill / `yellow200` border / `neutral900` text. Both off-token banners (AddReportModal, PrescriptionPage.styles) repointed.
- **Clinical reds → red100/200** — do suggested: `#E53E3E`/`#e53935`→red100 · `#b54040`→red200. (`#C0392B`/CLR-red-3 was **already fixed** in the Dropdowns phase → skipped.)
- **Invalid-field tint → CLR-invalidfill-2** = `redAlpha10`. All 7 `rgba(255,0,0,0.05)` sites (TextInput.styles + 6× BookAppointment) repointed.
- **Pharmacy CSV greens → secondary ONLY** (user override: "instead of green200, secondary only"): `#2C6E49` text/accent/border → `secondary600`; `#F1F8F3` fill → `secondary50`. No `green200` used. (Also converted the one `#2C6E49` in PrescriptionPage's AI-SOAP area for consistency.)
- ✅ BUILT: ~25 literals across 10 files swapped to tokens (PharmacyView, PrescriptionPage(+.styles), HomePage, FileViewer, SetupPasswordPage, AddServiceModal, AddReportModal, TextInput.styles, BookAppointment). The 2 amber borders became template literals to interpolate `colors.yellow200`. `tsc --noEmit` 0 errors.
- _Excluded (intentionally literal, untouched):_ art/illustration files + the print stylesheet.
- ⚠️ NOT click-tested live (login wall). Spot-check: Pharmacy CSV import zone (greens now olive/sage; greys now neutral), the AI-SOAP amber banner (text now near-black on soft yellow), and an invalid form field tint (Book Appointment).

## 10. Typography / spacing — _built, ready for review_
IDs: `TYPE-scale`+`TYPE-1..23`, `SPACE-scale`+`SPACE-1..9`, `RAD-scale`+`RAD-1..5`.
Decision: confirm off-scale sizes (9/10/15/22), weight 300, spacing 6/10, radii 3/9/24/40/55 should snap to scale.

## 11–12. Duplicates / merge — flagged inline in categories 2–7 (picker family, autocompletes, clinic/staff/queue cards, the two tables/status-pills).

## 13. Off-style pages — _built, ready for review (Category 11 in the gallery)_
IDs: `PAGE-*` rating table + `PAGE-setup/pharmacy/rx` drift mocks.
Decision: rebuild SetupPasswordPage on shared comps; tokenize Pharmacy CSV zone + Rx AI-modal/banners.

### Token-level decisions (cascade into everything)
| Topic | Question | Verdict |
